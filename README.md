# emailnewsletter
An email newsletter for Moms Can Code Cohort 3

Project by Sam Carlin and Marcie Ferrick

The HTML email newsletter is our first project for Moms Can Code School. To create the newsletter, we used HTML tables with inline CSS styling, and our header graphic was created with Canva. 

Note, as this email was created for a project, and not an actual company, the contact information has been made up and the unsubscribe "link" is not an actual link.
